    ### What is a Key?
    The encryption key is a **unique secret** that encrypts and decrypts your passwords.  
    Without it, you won't be able to retrieve your stored passwords.

    ### Instructions:
    1. Click the button below to generate a secure key.
    2. The key will be saved locally as a file named `secret.key`.
    3. Ensure you keep this file safe, as itâ€™s crucial for decrypting your passwords.

    **Note**: Losing the key means losing access to your passwords!
